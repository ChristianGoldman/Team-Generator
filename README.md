## My story
* This project enabled me to better understand how to utilize and build constructors
* This project enables a user to quickly build a team template with important information
* I have a better understanding on how exports and require work
* Better understanding on how inquirer prompts work
* Several inquirer prompts can be linked together after the .then function has been fulfilled
## Features ##
* An output folder will be created for you if you forget to create your own. The output folder is where your dynamically created html file will be placed.
* Allows the user to add any number of employees they desire
* Certain questions will only be displayed based upon what role they have selected for an employee
* Allows the user to simply fill in information in the commmand line and have an html page built just for them!
